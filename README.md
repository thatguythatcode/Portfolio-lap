# 🧪 O.A Digital Lab

A creative tech lab and portfolio built with **Next.js**, designed as a terminal-inspired digital playground to showcase UI experiments, lab notes, and interactive ideas across multiple languages and frameworks.

Explore animated interfaces, code-driven notes, and a command-style interface that responds to real input — all wrapped in a minimal, green-on-black hacker aesthetic.
