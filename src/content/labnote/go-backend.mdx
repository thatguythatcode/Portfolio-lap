# Go Backend Systems

Experiments using Go for backend services, CLIs, and concurrent tooling.

---

## 🌐 APIs with Gin

Built web APIs with:

* Route groups and middleware
* JWT authentication
* Rate limiting

```go
r := gin.Default()
r.GET("/ping", func(c *gin.Context) {
  c.JSON(200, gin.H{"message": "pong"})
})
```

---

## 🧵 Goroutines for Concurrency

* Multi-worker queue processing
* Channels for safe data sharing
* Timers and tickers for periodic jobs

---

## 📦 CLI Tools with Cobra

* Git-style command structure
* Helpful usage printing
* Config file parsing

---

## 🧠 Learnings

* Goroutines make concurrency approachable, but you must manage lifetimes
* The Go standard lib is impressively batteries-included
* Simple language, fast iteration — good for MVPs

---

## ✅ Next Experiments

* Distributed job queue in Go
* SQLite-backed microservice
* Cross-compilation for ARM devices

---

More Go-powered systems soon. 🦫
