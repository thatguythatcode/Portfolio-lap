# Swift UI/UX Experiments

UI/UX explorations on Apple platforms using native frameworks.

---

## 🎨 SwiftUI Components

* Custom toggle switches with animation
* Dynamic lists with diffing and drag-to-reorder
* Nested tab navigation

```swift
Toggle(isOn: $value) {
  Text("Enable Feature")
}
.toggleStyle(SwitchToggleStyle(tint: .blue))
```

---

## 📱 RealityKit & ARKit Tests

* Anchored AR UI overlays
* Spatial audio triggers
* Motion-driven UI feedback

---

## 🧠 Learnings

* SwiftUI speeds up prototyping but layout bugs can be obscure
* Combine and Swift concurrency simplify async UI logic
* Xcode Previews are invaluable for iteration

---

## ✅ Next Experiments

* WatchOS app with reactive graphs
* SwiftUI widget pack
* Mixed UIKit + SwiftUI interfaces

---

More Apple-native play coming 🍏
