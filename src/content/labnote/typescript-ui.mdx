# TypeScript Systems UI

Experiments focused on typed UI architectures and building maintainable, predictable state-driven UIs with TypeScript.

---

## ðŸ§­ State Machine UIs

Built deterministic UI flows with XState:

* Declarative state diagrams
* Machine logic mirrored in component structure
* Devtools for state inspection

```ts
const machine = createMachine({
  id: "formFlow",
  initial: "idle",
  states: {
    idle: { on: { FOCUS: "editing" } },
    editing: { on: { SUBMIT: "validating" } },
    validating: { on: { SUCCESS: "success", ERROR: "error" } },
    success: {},
    error: {},
  },
});
```

---

## ðŸ§ª Form Builders with Types

* Custom reusable form hooks with Zod validation
* Strongly typed form schemas
* Dynamic rendering based on field descriptors

```ts
type FormSchema = z.infer<typeof schema>
const { register, handleSubmit } = useForm<FormSchema>({ resolver: zodResolver(schema) });
```

---

## ðŸ”¬ Visual Debugging Panels

Made developer overlays for real-time inspection:

* Hook state tracing with `why-did-you-render`
* Time-traveling state in Redux Toolkit
* UI breakpoint visualizer overlays

---

## ðŸ§  Learnings

* Type inference with Zod or Yup greatly enhances dev ergonomics
* XState diagrams help onboard new developers
* TypeScript reduces edge case bugs when wiring complex props

---

## âœ… Next Experiments

* UI for finite automata simulation
* Component architecture explorer
* Strongly-typed theming system with tokens

---

More TypeScript-powered experiments coming ðŸ”§
