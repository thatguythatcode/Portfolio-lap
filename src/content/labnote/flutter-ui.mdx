# Flutter UI Experiments

Here I document weird and wonderful UIs Iâ€™ve built using **Flutter**, **Rive**, and lots of caffeine. ðŸ§¹

---

## ðŸŒ€ Animated Login Screens

Built a fully animated login screen with:

* Rive integration (custom loading animation)
* Haptic feedback on validation
* Smooth transitions between login and signup

```dart
RiveAnimation.asset(
  'assets/animations/login_loop.riv',
  fit: BoxFit.cover,
)
```

---

## ðŸŽ» Gesture-Driven Controls

Experimented with creating touch-based controls using `GestureDetector` and `CustomPaint`.

### Examples:

* Knob-style volume dial
* Sliders with animated feedback
* Tap-hold-rotate interactions

```dart
GestureDetector(
  onPanUpdate: (details) => updateValue(details),
  child: CustomPaint(painter: DialPainter(value)),
)
```

---

## ðŸª¿ Magic Mirror UI (Camera + Shader)

Used the `camera` plugin and GLSL shaders for a surreal UI effect:

* Real-time face distortion
* Color channel shifting based on voice pitch
* Tap to toggle "mirror modes"

```dart
ShaderMask(
  shaderCallback: (rect) => myCustomFragmentShader(rect),
  child: CameraPreview(controller),
)
```

---

## ðŸ›€ Rive State Machines

Played with more advanced Rive features:

* Synced form validation state to Rive inputs
* Animated character reacts to user typing
* Success trigger on form completion

```dart
controller.isActive = isFormValid;
riveArtboard.addController(controller);
```

---

## ðŸ§¹ Learnings

* Rive adds polish, but keep asset sizes in mind for mobile.
* Flutter animation APIs are surprisingly powerful â€” `AnimatedBuilder` + `TweenSequence` is your friend.
* Avoid nesting `setState()` with animations. It leads to jank.

---

## âœ… Next Experiments

* UI for a terminal-style dashboard
* Integrate voice and touch together
* Build a design system with motion baked in

Thanks for checking out the lab logs. ðŸš§
