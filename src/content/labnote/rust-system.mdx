# Rust Systems Experiments

Low-level, high-safety experiments exploring Rust for performance-focused tools, WebAssembly, and systems programming.

---

## ⚙️ CLI Tools with Clap

Built robust command-line utilities with:

* Argument parsing via `clap`
* Multi-threaded file I/O
* Colorized terminal outputs with `colored`

```rust
use clap::{App, Arg};
fn main() {
  let matches = App::new("Tool").arg(Arg::new("input").required(true)).get_matches();
  println!("Input file: {:?}", matches.value_of("input"));
}
```

---

## 🧪 WASM UI Components

* Built a WebAssembly-powered UI widget
* Shared logic between native + web
* Used `wasm-bindgen` for JS interop

---

## 🧠 Learnings

* Rust’s compiler teaches you to think about safety by default
* Building with Cargo + crates makes dependency management pleasant
* WASM opens the door to high-perf frontend modules without JS overhead

---

## ✅ Next Experiments

* Real-time log monitor UI in terminal
* GUI with Tauri or egui
* Compile Rust to embedded devices

More memory-safe madness to come. 🦀
