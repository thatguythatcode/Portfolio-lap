# Python Visualization & Automation

This note logs experiments where Python bridges data, automation, and AI into usable interfaces and internal tools.

---

## üìä Interactive Dashboards

Created data apps with Plotly Dash and Streamlit:

* Real-time sensor graphs from MQTT feeds
* Interactive filters for huge CSV datasets
* Theme toggle + export-to-PDF features

```python
import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd

data = pd.read_csv("metrics.csv")
st.line_chart(data["cpu_usage"])
```

---

## ü§ñ AI Prompt Tools

Built small LLM-based workflows using LangChain + OpenAI:

* Chat interface to summarize long reports
* Form-to-prompt UX for generating custom SQL queries
* Embedded vector search for internal knowledge

```python
from langchain.chains import LLMChain
chain = LLMChain(prompt=prompt_template, llm=chat_openai)
result = chain.run(input_data)
```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Automation Scripts

Automated daily ops with Python:

* Cron-based report generation with HTML exports
* SFTP backups using `paramiko`
* Notion + GitHub integration for daily changelogs

```python
import schedule, os
schedule.every().day.at("08:00").do(generate_report)
```

---

## üß† Learnings

* Streamlit makes data UIs very fast to prototype, but browser performance can bottleneck on large sets
* LangChain chains simplify complex LLM behaviors but require caching for production use
* Async + sched + requests is a reliable trio for most automation tasks

---

## ‚úÖ Next Experiments

* Build an AI-powered data validation dashboard
* Real-time crypto dashboard using WebSocket APIs
* Browser-based Python kernel with Pyodide

More data/AI/automation utilities to come. üß¨
